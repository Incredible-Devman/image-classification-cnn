Cat & Dog Classification
=====

## Description
There are many neural network architectures that has trained with lots of images; about 10000 images. But this project is ideal in case of that you have a small dataset.
Maybe it will produce the good result on the model.
The model is composed of Model and Layers of Keras. (Conv2D and MaxPooling2D)
This project has 4 sets of Conv2D and MaxPooling2D because it deals with big images.
It looks like a little complex problem but basically it is similar to the other convnets.
In the end, it has single unit (a Dense layer of size 1) and a sigmoid activation.
I have experimented with several images. Even though a man has difficulty in identifying it, this model may produce the good result.
